This GitHub repo is derived from code located at 
<http://scifac.ru.ac.za/resourcekit/download/index.htm>.

The project is compiled with sbt
<http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/>.

To build an executable jar use the 'proguard' task which will produce
an executable jar target/scala_2.8.1/engel-1.0.min.jar whose main
class is set to run Oolong by default.

There are five packages in this distribution:
* COM.sootNsmoke.jvm - a library for building Java (tm)  class files

* COM.sootNsmoke.oolong - A compiler and decompiler for Oolong, a
  language for building JVM class files.

* COM.sootNsmoke.instructions - Support classes for the jvm package.
  Abstractions of JVM instructions to make building code easier.

* COM.sootNsmoke.scheme - a nearly complete implementation of the R4
  Scheme specification, which compiles Scheme code into JVM bytecodes.

* COM.sootNsmoke.prolog - a simple Prolog compiler demonstrating how
